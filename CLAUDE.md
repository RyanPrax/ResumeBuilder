# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) and Codex when working with code in this repository.

It also serves as the **AI rules file** required by the CSC3100 final assignment submission. See `docs/ai-usage.md` for a narrative summary of how AI was used during development.

## Project Overview

**ResumeBuilder** — local-only single-page application for the CSC3100 final. Helps students store a library of jobs/projects/skills/certs/awards, then assemble a tailored, printable resume for a target role. Gemini AI is used on-demand to review user-entered prose. See `implementation_plan.md` for the full design.

Stack (locked by assignment):
- Frontend: vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, **no React or other frameworks**. SPA — single `public/index.html`, History API routing (`pushState` + `popstate`), views show/hide via DOM swaps.
- Styling: Bootstrap utility classes only. Custom CSS limited to `public/css/print.css` (print layout) and explicitly flagged in `implementation_plan.md`.
- Backend: Node.js + Express **RESTful** APIs. **No MVC, no SSR.**
- Database: SQLite via `better-sqlite3`.
- AI: Google Gemini via `@google/generative-ai`.
- Libraries: all vendored under `public/vendor/` — **no CDNs**.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Install deps
npm install

# Run the app (Express + static SPA)
npm start                # http://localhost:3000

# Unit tests
npm test

# Lint
npm run lint

# Format
npm run fmt

# Reset local DB (delete + reapply schema on next boot)
rm db/resume.db && npm start
```

## Architecture

- **server.js** — Express bootstrap. Serves `public/` as static, mounts JSON routers under `/api/*`, applies migrations on boot via `lib/db.js`. Catch-all handler returns `public/index.html` for any non-`/api` path so deep links and refreshes (e.g. `/builder/5`) resolve to the SPA shell.
- **lib/db.js** — `better-sqlite3` connection + schema migration runner. Reads `db/schema.sql` and applies it if `db/resume.db` is missing.
- **lib/gemini.js** — Gemini API wrapper. Loads `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY`, exposes `reviewSection(sectionType, text)`. Prompt templates per section type. Returns suggestions; never auto-writes user content.
- **routes/** — One Express router per resource: `contact.js`, `summary.js`, `educations.js`, `jobs.js` (bullets nested under `/api/jobs/:id/bullets`), `projects.js` (bullets nested under `/api/projects/:id/bullets`), `skills.js`, `skill-categories.js`, `certifications.js`, `awards.js`, `resumes.js`, `ai.js`. All return JSON.
- **db/schema.sql** — Single source of truth for tables. Single-user app, no auth. See `implementation_plan.md` § Data model for the full schema.
- **public/index.html** — SPA shell: skip-link, `<header>`, `<main id="view-root">`, `<footer>`, credits modal. Loads vendored Bootstrap + JS modules.
- **public/js/app.js** — History API router. Intercepts `<a data-spa>` clicks, calls `history.pushState`, listens for `popstate`, and dispatches to view modules. Exposes a `navigate(path)` helper for programmatic navigation after API calls.
- **public/js/views/** — `dashboard.js`, `profile.js`, `builder.js`, `preview.js`. Each renders into `#view-root` and wires delegated event listeners.
- **public/js/components/** — `form-helpers.js` (form binding utilities), `ai-review.js` ("Review with AI" button + suggestion popover).
- **public/js/api.js** — Thin `fetch` helpers for the `/api/*` surface.
- **public/js/pwa.js** — Service worker registration + install-prompt handling.
- **public/css/print.css** — `@media print` rules for the resume layout. **Custom CSS — flagged.** Hides app chrome, sets letter-size page, ATS-friendly type, page-break rules.
- **public/vendor/** — Vendored Bootstrap CSS+JS and any other third-party libraries. No CDN references anywhere in `index.html`.
- **public/manifest.webmanifest**, **public/service-worker.js** — PWA shell. Caches app shell on install; network-first for `/api/*`. Navigation requests (any non-`/api` path) fall back to cached `index.html` when offline so deep links keep working without a network round-trip.
- **docs/ai-usage.md** — Narrative AI-usage summary (required for submission).
- **docs/lighthouse.png** — Lighthouse accessibility ≥ 93 evidence (required for submission).
- **docs/sample-resume.pdf** — Example printed resume (required for submission).

## Routing & Views

Routes are real URL paths driven by the History API. The Express catch-all returns `index.html` for any non-`/api` path so refreshes and direct hits resolve correctly.

- `/` — redirects (via `history.replaceState`) to `/dashboard` on first load.
- `/dashboard` — saved resumes list + "New resume" + "Edit profile data".
- `/profile/:tab` — tabbed forms per entity (`contact`, `summary`, `education`, `jobs`, `projects`, `skills`, `certs`, `awards`).
- `/builder/:id` — resume metadata + checklist tree (sections → items → bullets).
- `/preview/:id` — digital render; "Print / Save as PDF" triggers `window.print()`.

In-app links use `<a href="/path" data-spa>`; the router intercepts `data-spa` clicks (skipping new-tab modifiers) and calls `history.pushState`. Programmatic transitions after API calls use `navigate('/builder/' + id)` exported from `app.js`. Back/forward fires `popstate`, which re-runs the dispatcher.

PDF export is **Phase 1: `window.print()` + `@media print` CSS**. If fidelity fails, fall back to vendored `html2pdf.js` or server-side Puppeteer (see `implementation_plan.md`).

## AI Integration

- Endpoint: `POST /api/ai/review` — body `{sectionType, text}`, returns `{suggestions: string[]}`.
- Trigger: per-field "Review with AI" button (no auto-review on input).
- Frontend never auto-applies suggestions — user accepts/dismisses in a popover.
- Missing `GEMINI_API_KEY` → 400 with friendly message in popover. App still works without AI.

The assignment also requires a UI for users to supply their own Gemini key. Current implementation reads from `.env` only; the deviation is documented in `README.md` and `docs/ai-usage.md`.

## AI-Assisted Code

Per assignment policy, any code generated or substantially shaped by AI must be marked. Use a leading comment on the block:

```js
// AI: Generated with Claude Code — print stylesheet @media query for letter-size layout.
```

Keep the comment short. If a whole file was AI-generated, mark it once at the top.

`docs/ai-usage.md` indexes the AI workflow: tools used (Claude Code), rules file (this file), MCP servers (if any), and a list of significant AI contributions.

## Environment Configuration

- **Stages**: dev only (local). No staging/prod — see `DEV-WORKFLOW.md`.
- **Secrets**: `.env` file at repo root, gitignored. Keys: `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- **Database**: `db/resume.db` (gitignored). Created on first boot from `db/schema.sql`.
- **Port**: `3000` by default. Override with `PORT=4000 npm start`.

`.env.example` is committed and shows the expected keys with empty values.

## Development Workflow

Trunk-based development (see `DEV-WORKFLOW.md`):
- `main` is always runnable; use short-lived `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/` branches.
- All PRs must pass CI (lint + test) before merge.
- Feature flags / hidden views for incomplete work.

### Before Every Commit

```bash
npm run lint && npm test
```

Both must pass. Fix failures before staging files.

If UI changed, re-run Lighthouse on the affected view and confirm accessibility score is still ≥ 93. Update `docs/lighthouse.png` for the final submission.

## Git Conventions

### Branch Naming

Lowercase with hyphens, prefixed by type:

- `feature/` — new features (e.g., `feature/builder-checklist`)
- `bugfix/` — bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/print-page-break`)
- `hotfix/` — critical fixes
- `release/` — release / submission tags
- `docs/` — documentation (e.g., `docs/ai-usage`)

Always delete local branches after they merge to `main`.

### Commit Messages ([Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/))

Format: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`

Breaking changes: append `!` after type/scope (e.g., `feat!: change resume schema`).

## Frontend / Templates

Always let the user review changes to `public/index.html` and any HTML fragments before committing. After editing, summarize what changed and wait for explicit approval before running `git commit`.

## Code Style

- **Bootstrap utilities only.** Do not add custom CSS rules. The single permitted exception is `public/css/print.css` (print layout). If a custom rule is unavoidable elsewhere, raise it explicitly — it must be added to the flagged-CSS list in `implementation_plan.md`.
- Vanilla JS, ES modules. **No React, Vue, jQuery, or other frameworks.**
- 4-space indentation, semicolons, double quotes (enforced by Prettier via `npm run fmt`).
- Express routes return JSON. No server-side rendering, no MVC layering.
- Keep `index.html` thin — JS and CSS live in modular files under `public/js/` and `public/css/`.
- Accessibility is non-negotiable: semantic landmarks, labeled inputs, keyboard navigability, focus management in modals, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected. Target Lighthouse a11y ≥ 93.

## Dependencies

- Package manager: `npm`.
- Production deps: `express`, `better-sqlite3`, `dotenv`, `@google/generative-ai`.
- Dev deps: `eslint`, `prettier`, a test runner (e.g., `node --test` or `vitest`).
- Always keep `package.json` and `package-lock.json` in sync (`npm install` regenerates the lock).
- **Always check for CVEs and security advisories** before installing or updating any package or GitHub Action (`npm audit`, GitHub Advisory Database).
- All third-party browser libraries (Bootstrap, etc.) must be **vendored** under `public/vendor/` — no `<script src="https://cdn..."></script>` references in `index.html`.

## Coding Conventions

- **Hungarian Notation**: Use Hungarian notation for variable naming. For example, a string variable like "String" will be named strFoo, a decimal/float like 0.75 will be named decBar, an sqlite connection will be named dbDatabase. **Exception**: variables that map directly to database columns (e.g. in route handlers binding request body fields to SQL columns) should match the column name exactly (e.g. `full_name`, `links_json`) to avoid cognitive overhead and keep DB mappings transparent.
- **camelCase**: Use camelCase when naming all variables
- **Async Javascript**: Prefer to use async await rather than .then() when performing asynchronous javascript functions
- **No Build Tools**: Avoid build tools such as Babel, Webpack, or Vite, unless it is explicitly required. Code must run either directly in the browser or via nodeJS
- **Dependencies**: Do not add external libraries such as jQuery without approval. Prefer native Web APIs
- **ECMAScript Version**: Target ES6+ features including arrow functions and template literals as well as promises
- **External Libraries Local**: All external libraries that are included must NOT use a CDN, but rather be included in project source files
- **Bootstrap Utility Classes**: Use only standard Bootstrap 5+ utility classes for layout, spacing, and colors. Avoid creating CSS classes or inline styles unless the design cannot be achieved without them
- **Comments**: Provide verbose comments to explain the flow of the code and anything that would be difficult for a beginner developer to understand
- **Database queries**: Always use `.all()` for SELECT queries, even when only one row is expected. This keeps all API responses as JSON arrays and simplifies frontend handling.

## Accessibility

- **Standards**: All user interfaces MUST meet WCAG 2.1+ accessibility standards
- **Alt tags**: All images must have an alt tag attribute that describes the image
- **Priority**: Prioritize accessibility over design
- **Aria Labels**: Include aria labels on all HTML form controls

## Project Structure

- **Entry Point**: All nodeJS applications must use server.js for entry point
- **API Routes**: All api routes must be included in the /api/ routing

## API Requirements

- **RESTful**: All api routes should be RESTful in design
- **UPDATE**: All UPDATE routes should use PUT rather than PATCH
- **DELETE**: DELETE routes should use URL parameters for primary key indicators
- **SELECT**: All user inputs for SELECT should be passed via URL query strings
- **CREATE**: All user inputs for CREATES should be passed as JSON body data
- **Input validation**: All user-passed inputs should be validated
- **SELECT RETURN**: All SELECT should return JSON arrays
- **Status Codes**: Every route must return appropriate HTTP status codes for both success and error

## DO NOT

- Do not hardcode credentials
- Do not intermix user inputs in queries, require prepared statements
- Do not skip input validation
- Do not leak error information to the end user, instead log it to the server's console

## Decision Guidelines

- Prefer simpler, less complex, and maintainable code
- Ask for clarification if uncertain
- **Keep everything in sync**: whenever a design decision changes, update all affected code, routes, schema, and docs (`CLAUDE.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, etc.) in the same commit. Never leave any file — code or doc — describing a design that no longer matches reality.

## Testing

Run tests with `npm test` (Node's built-in `node:test` runner). All tests must pass before every commit — see **Before Every Commit** above.

### What requires tests

**Must have tests:**
- **API route handlers** (`routes/*.js`) — every route file needs a corresponding test file in `tests/`.
- **Library modules with logic** (`lib/db.js`, `lib/gemini.js`) — connection, schema, migration, prompt construction, and any non-trivial helper.
- **Security-sensitive code** — input validation, injection detection, sanitization. Test both the blocked cases and that legitimate input passes through cleanly.

**Does not need tests:**
- HTML markup (`public/index.html`) — verified by Lighthouse and manual review.
- CSS (`public/css/`, Bootstrap utility classes) — visual correctness is not machine-testable here.
- Frontend view and component modules (`public/js/views/`, `public/js/components/`, `public/js/app.js`) — DOM manipulation; verify manually in the browser.
- `server.js` — thin bootstrap; covered implicitly by route tests that spin up Express.

### Test file placement

```
tests/
  ai.test.js            ← routes/ai.js
  contact.test.js       ← routes/contact.js
  awards.test.js        ← routes/awards.js
  ...
lib/
  db.test.js            ← lib/db.js (co-located, existing convention)
```

### How to write route tests

Spin up a minimal Express app on an ephemeral port — do not rely on the real server running. See `tests/ai.test.js` for the established pattern using `before()`/`after()` and `node:http` + `fetch`.

### Minimum assertions per route type

| Route | Assert |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | 200, body is a JSON array (empty array is valid) |
| `GET /:id` | 200 + array for a known ID; array for unknown ID |
| `POST /` | 201 on success; 400 when any required field is missing |
| `PUT /:id` | 200 on success; 400 when required field missing; 404 for unknown ID |
| `DELETE /:id` | 200 on success; 404 for unknown ID |

Use `id=999999` to trigger 404s without inserting test data.

### Do not mock the database

Route tests must hit the real SQLite DB. Mocking the DB risks tests passing while real queries break. GET and validation tests work on an empty DB with no setup. For tests that need a record (e.g. `PUT /:id`), insert it in the test and delete it in `after()`.
